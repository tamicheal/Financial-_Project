To add to update on the tools I will be using, I plan on taking my database off-premises using Azure and Azure’s database features.

TOOL
1.Git
2.GitBash
3.GitHub
4.Azure
5.MSSQL
6.AI
7.DBreavor
8.Excel
9.Tableau

I’ll go through the issues I ran into along the way.  

Ran into issues and which I was able to learn about formatting databases before transferring. 

A tool Azure offer to assist is Call “Azure SQL Database Migration Tool” follow the steps below.

The Azure SQL Database Migration Assistant tool can be downloaded from the Azure portal. Here's how to download it:

1. Go to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in with your Azure account.

2. Click on "Create a resource" in the left-hand menu.

3. Search for "Azure Database Migration Service" in the search box and select it from the results.

4. Click on "Create" to create a new instance of the Azure Database Migration Service.

5. In the "Create Migration Service" blade, specify the subscription, resource group, and other details as required.

6. In the "Networking" section, configure the virtual network and subnet for the migration service.

7. In the "Advanced" section, select the "Enable Azure Service Endpoints" option.

8. Click on "Review + create" to review the configuration and create the migration service.

9. Once the migration service is created, go to the "Tools" section and download the Azure SQL Database Migration Assistant tool.

Note that the Azure SQL Database Migration Assistant tool is also available for download separately from the Azure portal. You can search for "Azure SQL Database Migration Assistant" on the Microsoft website and download it from there.

Next Steps

The migration process for moving a database from MSSQL to Azure typically involves the following steps:

1. Assess the database: Before migrating the database, it is essential to assess the database's compatibility with Azure SQL Database. This involves checking the database schema, objects, and features to ensure they are supported in Azure.

2. Create an Azure SQL Database: Create an Azure SQL Database instance in the Azure portal, which will serve as the destination for the migrated database.

3. Export the database: Export the database from the on-premises SQL Server into a BACPAC file. This file contains the database schema and data.

4. Transfer the BACPAC file: Transfer the BACPAC file to Azure, either through the Azure portal or using Azure Data Migration Service (DMS).

5. Import the database: Import the BACPAC file into the Azure SQL Database instance. This step creates the database schema and data in the Azure SQL Database.

6. Test and validate: After the migration is complete, test the database to ensure that it works correctly and validate that all the data has been successfully migrated.

It is essential to plan the migration process carefully, considering factors such as database size, network connectivity, and downtime requirements. Additionally, it is recommended to test the migration process in a non-production environment before performing the actual migration to minimize the risk of data loss or downtime.

I’m looking to create real world experiences from start to finish. I Have an Azure database already up and running. I’ll be working with it

If you have a sample database that you can use for testing and experimentation, that can be a great way to get started with Azure migration services. You can use the sample database to try out different migration tools and strategies, and to get a better understanding of how your on-premises database will behave in a cloud environment.

Here are some steps you can follow to get started with migrating your sample database to Azure:

1. Assess the database: Use one of the assessment tools I mentioned earlier (such as Azure Migrate, Data Migration Assistant, or Azure Database Migration Service) to assess your sample database. This will help you identify any compatibility issues and estimate the costs of running the database in Azure.

2. Choose a migration strategy: Based on the results of the assessment, choose a migration strategy that's appropriate for your sample database. For example, you might choose to use the Azure Database Migration Service to perform an online migration, or you might choose to use the Data Migration Assistant to generate a migration script that you can manually execute.

3. Perform the migration: Once you've chosen a migration strategy, perform the migration on your sample database. Be sure to test the database thoroughly to ensure that it's functioning as expected.

4. Monitor and optimize: After the migration is complete, monitor the performance of the database in Azure and optimize the resource usage as needed to ensure optimal performance.

By using your sample database to experiment with Azure migration services, you can gain valuable experience and confidence in the migration process, which can help you when it comes time to migrate your production databases.

This process has been a learning experience for sure!!

Some common issues that my come during the assessment and migration process;

1. Compatibility issues: Incompatibilities between the source and target environments can cause migration failures. For example, if the database schema or data types are not supported in the target environment, the migration may fail.

2. Insufficient resources: If the target environment does not have enough resources to support the migrated database, the migration may fail. This can include issues such as insufficient storage, insufficient memory, or insufficient network bandwidth.

3. Network issues: Network connectivity issues can cause migrations to fail. For example, if there is network congestion or packet loss during the migration process, it can cause the migration to fail.

4. Security issues: If the security settings in the target environment are not configured correctly, the migration may fail. This can include issues such as incorrect firewall settings or incorrect permissions.

5. Migration tool issues: Issues with the migration tool itself can also cause migrations to fail. For example, if the tool encounters a bug or error during the migration process, it can cause the migration to fail.

To avoid migration failures, it's important to thoroughly assess the source environment before beginning the migration process, and to carefully plan and execute the migration process using a reputable migration tool. It's also a good idea to perform thorough testing and validation after the migration is complete to ensure that the migrated database is functioning as expected.
