## EDA Exploration Data analysis

EDA can be a valuable tool in financial analysis, as it can help you identify trends and patterns in financial data that can inform investment decisions and strategic planning. Here are some steps you can follow for EDA in financial analysis:

<details>
 <summary><b>1. Define your question:</b><summary>
    Start by defining a clear question or hypothesis that you want to answer. For example, you may want to explore trends in a particular market or industry, or investigate the factors that are driving changes in a company's financial performance.
</details>

<details>
 <summary><b>2. Gather and clean the data:</b><summary>
    Collect the relevant financial data and ensure that it is clean and accurate. This may involve removing duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting errors.
</details>

<details>
 <summary><b>3. Calculate summary statistics:</b><summary>
    Use SQL functions such as `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX` to calculate summary statistics for relevant variables, such as revenue, expenses, profits, and debt.
</details>

<details>
 <summary><b>4. Create visualizations:</b><summary>
    Use SQL functions such as `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` to create visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, and scatter plots. These can help you identify trends and patterns in the data, such as seasonal fluctuations or correlations between variables.
</details>

<details>
 <summary><b>5. Conduct ratio analysis:</b><summary>
    Use SQL functions to calculate and analyze financial ratios, such as liquidity ratios, profitability ratios, and debt ratios, which can provide insights into a company's financial performance and health.
</details>

<details>
 <summary><b>6. Identify outliers and anomalies:</b><summary>
    Use SQL functions such as `COUNT` and `GROUP BY` to identify outliers and anomalies in the data, which may require further investigation.
</details>

<details>
 <summary><b>7. Refine your analysis:</b><summary>
    EDA is an iterative process, so it's important to refine your analysis as you go and adjust your approach based on the insights you gain. You may need to repeat certain steps or try different techniques to get a full understanding of the data.
</details>

By following these steps, you can use EDA to gain insights into financial data and inform investment decisions and strategic planning.

## What is compensation operations?

In the context of business or employment, compensation generally refers to the total package of salary, benefits, and other forms of payment that an employee receives from their employer in exchange for their work. Compensation operations could refer to the processes and systems used by a company to manage and administer employee compensation, such as calculating pay rates, managing benefits programs, and tracking employee attendance and performance. Is there a specific context or industry you had in mind?

In the context of business sales, compensation operations may refer to the methods and systems a company uses to compensate its salespeople. This could include the structure of the sales commission plan, the tracking and reporting of sales performance, and the payment of commissions and bonuses.

For example, a company may use a commission-based compensation plan for its sales team, where salespeople are paid a percentage of the revenue generated by their sales. Compensation operations in this case would involve setting the commission rate, calculating and tracking sales revenue, and processing commission payments.

Compensation operations may also involve setting sales targets and goals, providing sales training and support, and monitoring sales performance to ensure that sales targets are being met and that salespeople are being appropriately compensated based on their performance.
 
## Tableau Dashboard 
To calculate sales revenue and process commission payments a simple dashboard than
build a more complex one

The Question What is the total sales revenue?

What is the commission payments for each sales reps?

What is the trend my month to date?

Next importing data into sql, Good news I have already clean data for the sales team I'm familiar with the reporting. I clean that data in MSSQL process it into Excel for more cleaning and formatting with power query. i have a tableau public dashboard will come with that link here--> https://public.tableau.com/views/Sales_dasboard_16806600683540/Europe?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
that dashboard is not complete but I am doing the same reporting. that report only had call center data and call center sales team info.

## Next Steps

Here's an example of how you could write SQL code to calculate sales revenue and commission payments for a simple commission structure:

Assuming you have two tables: a "sales" table that contains information about each sale, and a "salespeople" table that contains information about each salesperson, including their commission rate.

```
-- Calculate total sales revenue
SELECT SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales_revenue
FROM sales;

-- Calculate commission payments
SELECT salesperson_id, SUM(sales_amount * commission_rate) AS commission_payments
FROM sales
JOIN salespeople ON sales.salesperson_id = salespeople.salesperson_id
GROUP BY salesperson_id;
```

In this example, the first query calculates the total sales revenue by summing up the sales_amount column in the sales table.

The second query joins the sales table with the salespeople table on the salesperson_id column, and
calculates the commission payments for each salesperson by multiplying the sales_amount by the commission_rate for each sale, and then summing up those values for each salesperson. The result is a table that shows the salesperson_id and the commission_payments for each salesperson.
PS I will be using SQLite for EDA ops
that code is below

```
-- Calculate total sales revenue
SELECT SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales_revenue
FROM sales;

-- Calculate commission payments
SELECT salesperson_id, SUM(sales_amount * commission_rate) AS commission_payments
FROM sales
JOIN salespeople ON sales.salesperson_id = salespeople.salesperson_id
GROUP BY salesperson_id;
```

In SQLite, you would execute these queries using a SQLite client or in the SQLite command-line interface. Make sure to replace "sales" and "salespeople" with the names of your actual tables,and "sales_amount" and "commission_rate" with the names of the columns in your tables that contain this information.
