The question I want to review before diving into sql

The Question 

**Keep in mind**Be careful not to mix up or confuse the six stages of the data life cycle (Plan, Capture, Manage, Analyze, Archive, and Destroy) with the six phases of the data analysis life cycle (Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act). They shouldn't be used or referred to interchangeably.


What is the total sales revenue?

What tables have sales revenue,
I’ll run ‘SELECT’ statements to explore the data I am familiar with the database itself.


- SalesOrderHeader: Contains information about each sales order, such as the order date, customer information, and total due amount.
- SalesOrderDetail: Contains information about each product sold in a sales order, such as the product ID, quantity, and unit price.
- SalesTerritory: Contains information about each sales territory, including the name and sales quota.
- SalesPerson: Contains information about each salesperson, including their name, job title, and sales quota.
- SalesPersonQuotaHistory: Contains information about the sales quota history for each salesperson.
- SalesTaxRate: Contains information about the tax rate for each state or province.

These tables can be joined together using primary and foreign key relationships to analyze sales revenue by various dimensions, such as product, customer, sales territory, and time period.

Here's an example SQL code that demonstrates how to join a sales or transactions table with a product or inventory table to calculate the sales revenue by product:

```
SELECT 
  p.product_name, 
  SUM(s.quantity * s.unit_price) AS total_revenue
FROM 
  sales_table s
JOIN 
  product_table p
ON 
  s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY 
  p.product_name;
```

In this example, we assume that there is a `sales_table` containing information about each sale transaction, including the `product_id`, `quantity`, and `unit_price`, and a `product_table` containing information about each product, including the `product_id` and `product_name`. 

The `JOIN` clause is used to join the two tables together based on the `product_id` column. The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group the resulting rows by `product_name`, so that the `SUM` function can be used to calculate the total revenue for each product. 

Note that the above code is just an example, and the actual SQL code you would use may vary depending on your specific database schema and requirements. 

What is the commission payments for each sales reps?

This I formation should be in the HR department hands so I will query there as well and ‘JOIN’ what is needed.

I will need to ‘GROUP’ them by sales representatives.

What tables have this information and how is commission payments calculated by percentage?

What is the trend by month to date?

To calculate the trend by month for sales, you can use a combination of SQL and Excel. Here are the steps:

1. In SQL, write a query to retrieve the monthly sales data. The query should group the sales by month and calculate the total sales for each month. For example:

   ```
   SELECT YEAR(OrderDate) AS SalesYear, MONTH(OrderDate) AS SalesMonth, SUM(TotalDue) AS MonthlySales
   FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
   GROUP BY YEAR(OrderDate), MONTH(OrderDate)
   ORDER BY SalesYear, SalesMonth
   ```

   This query retrieves the year, month, and total sales for each sales order header in the AdventureWorks database, groups the data by year and month, and calculates the sum of the TotalDue column for each group.

2. Export the query result to a CSV file.

3. Open the CSV file in Excel and create a chart to display the monthly sales trend. To create a chart, select the SalesMonth and MonthlySales columns and then click the Insert tab in the Excel ribbon. Choose a chart type, such as a line chart, and customize the chart as needed.

4. To calculate the trend line for the chart, select the chart and then click the Chart Design tab in the Excel ribbon. Click the Add Chart Element button and choose Trend-line > Linear.

5. The trend-line equation and R-squared value will now appear on the chart. The equation represents the slope of the trend-line, which indicates the rate of change in sales over time. The R-squared value indicates how well the trend-line fits the data, with higher values indicating a better fit.

By following these steps, you can calculate and visualize the monthly sales trend for AdventureWorks data, and determine the slope and goodness of fit of the trend-line.

Tableau Steps

Sure, here's how you can calculate the trend by month for sales in Tableau:

1. Connect to your data source, which in this case would be the AdventureWorks database.

2. Create a new worksheet and drag the Order Date field to the Columns shelf.

3. Change the date format to Month/Year by right-clicking the Order Date field and selecting "Month/Year" under "Default Properties".

4. Drag the Total Due field to the Rows shelf to display the monthly sales data.

5. To calculate the trend line, right-click on the Total Due axis and select "Add Trend Line".

6. In the "Add Trend Line" dialog box, select "Linear" as the trend type and check the box for "Show R-squared value on tooltip" to display the goodness of fit on the chart.

7. Click OK to add the trend line to the chart.

8. You can also add a reference line to the chart to show the average sales for the entire period. To do this, right-click on the Total Due axis and select "Add Reference Line". In the "Add Reference Line" dialog box, select "Average" as the type and click OK.

9. Customize the chart as needed, such as adding a title, adjusting the axis labels, and formatting the trend line and reference line.

With these steps, you can create a chart in Tableau that shows the monthly sales trend and calculates the trend line.

# Next A list of SQL FROM beginner to Advanced 

here are some examples of how you could use these basic SQL techniques for financial analysis:

1. Aggregate functions: you can use aggregate functions to calculate basic financial metrics such as total revenue or average cost. For example, the following query calculates the total revenue for a given product:

```
SELECT SUM(Quantity * Price) AS Revenue
FROM Sales
WHERE ProductID = @ProductID
```

2. Group by: you can use the GROUP BY clause to group financial data by dimensions such as time, geography, or product lines. For example, the following query calculates the total revenue by quarter:

```
SELECT YEAR(OrderDate) AS Year, 
       QUARTER(OrderDate) AS Quarter, 
       SUM(Quantity * Price) AS Revenue
FROM Sales
GROUP BY YEAR(OrderDate), QUARTER(OrderDate)
```

3. Join: you can use joins to combine financial data from multiple tables, such as sales data and product information. For example, the following query retrieves all sales for a given product, along with its name and cost:

```
SELECT Sales.OrderID, Sales.Quantity, Sales.Price, Products.ProductName, Products.UnitCost
FROM Sales
INNER JOIN Products ON Sales.ProductID = Products.ProductID
WHERE Sales.ProductID = @ProductID
```

4. Subqueries: you can use subqueries to filter financial data based on criteria such as maximum or minimum values. For example, the following query retrieves all sales for the most expensive product:

```
SELECT Sales.OrderID, Sales.Quantity, Sales.Price, Products.ProductName
FROM Sales
INNER JOIN Products ON Sales.ProductID = Products.ProductID
WHERE Products.UnitPrice = (SELECT MAX(UnitPrice) FROM Products)
```

5. Order by: you can use the ORDER BY clause to sort financial data by metrics such as revenue, profit, or growth rate. For example, the following query retrieves the top 10 products by revenue:

```
SELECT Products.ProductName, SUM(Sales.Quantity * Sales.Price) AS Revenue
FROM Sales
INNER JOIN Products ON Sales.ProductID = Products.ProductID
GROUP BY Products.ProductName
ORDER BY Revenue DESC
LIMIT 10
```

6. Limit: you can use the LIMIT clause to restrict the number of rows returned by a query, which can be useful for financial reports or dashboards. For example, the following query retrieves the top 5 salespeople by revenue:

```
SELECT Employees.FirstName, Employees.LastName, SUM(Sales.Quantity * Sales.Price) AS Revenue
FROM Sales
INNER JOIN Employees ON Sales.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
GROUP BY Employees.FirstName, Employees.LastName
ORDER BY Revenue DESC
LIMIT 5
```

Here are some examples of how you could use these advanced SQL techniques for intermediate level financial analysis:

1. Window functions: you can use window functions to calculate financial ratios such as price-to-earnings (P/E) or price-to-book (P/B) ratios. For example, the following query calculates the P/E ratio for each stock in a given portfolio:

```
WITH EarningsCTE AS (
   SELECT StockID, SUM(Earnings) AS TotalEarnings
   FROM QuarterlyReports
   GROUP BY StockID
)
SELECT StockID, Price / (EarningsCTE.TotalEarnings / 4) AS PE_Ratio
FROM Stocks
INNER JOIN EarningsCTE ON Stocks.StockID = EarningsCTE.StockID
```

2. Common Table Expressions (CTEs): you can use CTEs to calculate financial metrics such as return on investment (ROI) or net present value (NPV). For example, the following query calculates the NPV for a given investment at a discount rate of 10%:

```
WITH CashFlowsCTE AS (
   SELECT InvestmentID, CashFlow / POWER(1.1, Year - 1) AS DiscountedCashFlow
   FROM CashFlows
   WHERE InvestmentID = @InvestmentID
)
SELECT SUM(DiscountedCashFlow) AS NPV
FROM CashFlowsCTE
```

3. Recursive queries: you can use recursive queries to traverse financial hierarchies such as account structures or financial statements. For example, the following query returns all accounts and their subaccounts in a hierarchical format:

```
WITH AccountHierarchy AS (
   SELECT AccountID, AccountName, ParentID, 0 AS Level
   FROM Accounts
   WHERE ParentID IS NULL
   UNION ALL
   SELECT Accounts.AccountID, Accounts.AccountName, Accounts.ParentID, AccountHierarchy.Level + 1
   FROM Accounts
   INNER JOIN AccountHierarchy ON Accounts.ParentID = AccountHierarchy.AccountID
)
SELECT REPLICATE('-', Level) + AccountName AS AccountPath, Balance
FROM AccountHierarchy
LEFT JOIN Balances ON AccountHierarchy.AccountID = Balances.AccountID
```

4. Stored procedures: you can use stored procedures to automate financial workflows such as budgeting or forecasting. For example, the following stored procedure calculates the net income and generates an alert if it falls below a certain threshold:

```
CREATE PROCEDURE CalculateNetIncome
   @Threshold DECIMAL(18,2)
AS
BEGIN
   DECLARE @NetIncome DECIMAL(18,2)
   SET @NetIncome = (SELECT SUM(Revenue) - SUM(Expenses) FROM IncomeStatement)
   IF @NetIncome < @Threshold
   BEGIN
      EXEC sp_send_dbmail @recipients='finance@company.com', @subject='Net Income Alert', @body='Net income is below threshold'
   END
END
```

5. Indexes: you can use indexes to improve the performance of financial queries that involve complex joins or aggregations. For example, the following index improves the performance of a query that retrieves all transactions for a given account:

```
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_account ON Transactions (AccountID)
```

6. Pivot tables: you can use pivot tables to summarize financial data and compare metrics across dimensions such as time, product lines, or geographies. For example, the following query summarizes the revenue and profit by product line and quarter:

```
SELECT ProductLine, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN Quarter = 'Q1' THEN Revenue ELSE 0 END) AS 'Q1 Revenue',
       SUM(CASE WHEN Quarter = 'Q1' THEN Profit ELSE 0 END) AS 'Q1 Profit',
       SUM(CASE WHEN Quarter = 'Q2' THEN Revenue ELSE 0 END) AS 'Q2 Revenue',
       SUM(CASE WHEN Quarter = 'Q2' THEN Profit ELSE 0 END) AS 'Q2 Profit',
       SUM(CASE WHEN Quarter = 'Q3' THEN Revenue ELSE 0 END) AS 'Q3 Revenue',
       SUM(CASE WHEN Quarter = 'Q3' THEN Profit ELSE 0 END) AS 'Q3 Profit',
       SUM(CASE WHEN Quarter = 'Q4' THEN Revenue ELSE 0 END) AS 'Q4 Revenue',
       SUM(CASE WHEN Quarter = 'Q4' THEN Profit ELSE 0 END) AS 'Q4 Profit'
FROM Sales
INNER JOIN Products ON Sales.ProductID = Products.ProductID
GROUP BY ProductLine
```

Note that these are just examples, and the syntax may vary depending on the specific database management system you are using.
Sure, here are some examples of how you could use these advanced SQL techniques for financial information:

1. Window functions: you can use window functions to calculate running totals or moving averages over financial data. For example, the following query calculates the 12-month moving average of sales for each product:

```
SELECT ProductID, OrderDate, Quantity, 
       AVG(Quantity) OVER(PARTITION BY ProductID ORDER BY OrderDate ROWS BETWEEN 11 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS MovingAverage
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN OrderDetails ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID
```

2. Common Table Expressions (CTEs): you can use CTEs to aggregate financial data and calculate metrics such as revenue, profit, and margins. For example, the following query calculates the total revenue and profit for each product category:

```
WITH SalesCTE AS (
   SELECT Products.CategoryID, OrderDetails.Quantity, OrderDetails.UnitPrice, 
          SUM(OrderDetails.Quantity * OrderDetails.UnitPrice) AS Revenue,
          SUM(OrderDetails.Quantity * (OrderDetails.UnitPrice - Products.UnitCost)) AS Profit
   FROM OrderDetails
   INNER JOIN Products ON OrderDetails.ProductID = Products.ProductID
   GROUP BY Products.CategoryID, OrderDetails.Quantity, OrderDetails.UnitPrice
)
SELECT Categories.CategoryName, SUM(SalesCTE.Revenue) AS TotalRevenue, SUM(SalesCTE.Profit) AS TotalProfit
FROM SalesCTE
INNER JOIN Categories ON SalesCTE.CategoryID = Categories.CategoryID
GROUP BY Categories.CategoryName
```

3. Recursive queries: you can use recursive queries to traverse financial hierarchies such as organizational charts or product categories. For example, the following query returns all products and their subcategories in a hierarchical format:

```
WITH CategoryHierarchy AS (
   SELECT CategoryID, CategoryName, ParentID, 0 AS Level
   FROM Categories
   WHERE ParentID IS NULL
   UNION ALL
   SELECT Categories.CategoryID, Categories.CategoryName, Categories.ParentID, CategoryHierarchy.Level + 1
   FROM Categories
   INNER JOIN CategoryHierarchy ON Categories.ParentID = CategoryHierarchy.CategoryID
)
SELECT REPLICATE('-', Level) + CategoryName AS CategoryPath, Products.ProductName
FROM CategoryHierarchy
LEFT JOIN Products ON CategoryHierarchy.CategoryID = Products.CategoryID
```

4. Stored procedures: you can use stored procedures to automate financial tasks such as generating reports, calculating metrics, or sending alerts. For example, the following stored procedure calculates the total revenue and profit for a given product category:

```
CREATE PROCEDURE GetSalesByCategory
   @CategoryID INT
AS
BEGIN
   SELECT SUM(OrderDetails.Quantity * OrderDetails.UnitPrice) AS TotalRevenue,
          SUM(OrderDetails.Quantity * (OrderDetails.UnitPrice - Products.UnitCost)) AS TotalProfit
   FROM OrderDetails
   INNER JOIN Products ON OrderDetails.ProductID = Products.ProductID
   WHERE Products.CategoryID = @CategoryID
END
```

5. Indexes: you can use indexes to improve the performance of financial queries that involve large datasets. For example, the following index improves the performance of a query that retrieves all orders for a given customer:

```
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer ON Orders (CustomerID)
```

6. Pivot tables: you can use pivot tables to summarize financial data and compare metrics across time periods or categories. For example, the following query summarizes the total revenue and profit for each product category by year:

```
SELECT CategoryName, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR(OrderDate) = 2020 THEN OrderDetails.Quantity * OrderDetails.UnitPrice ELSE 0 END) AS '2020 Revenue',
       SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR(OrderDate) = 2020 THEN OrderDetails.Quantity * (OrderDetails.UnitPrice - Products.UnitCost) ELSE 0 END) AS '2020 Profit',
       SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR(OrderDate) = 2019 THEN OrderDetails.Quantity * OrderDetails.UnitPrice ELSE 0 END) AS '2019 Revenue',
       SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR(OrderDate) = 2019 THEN OrderDetails.Quantity * (OrderDetails.UnitPrice - Products.UnitCost) ELSE 0 END) AS '2019 Profit'
FROM OrderDetails
INNER JOIN Products ON OrderDetails.ProductID = Products.ProductID
INNER JOIN Categories ON Products.CategoryID = Categories.CategoryID
INNER JOIN Orders ON OrderDetails.OrderID = Orders.OrderID
GROUP BY CategoryName
```
